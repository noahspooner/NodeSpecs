#NodeSpecs

A JavaScript file that shows your system's specs on the command line using Node.js.

You must have Node.js installed on your computer to run this.


How to use:

Simply download the zip folder by pressing the green code button on the project's main page and then press 'Download ZIP'. Once this is done, you can unzip the folder on your computer. After this, open a terminal (or PowerShell if you're a Windows user) and cd into the directory. Once you've done this, you must enter 'node index.js' (but remove the quotes) and the program will run like intended.
